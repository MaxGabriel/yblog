## Personal choice

* **Front end**: Take any reactive framework. The most popular is boostrap, so why not?
Most informations are in the %html. So could be handled on the server side.
* **Server side**: Yesod

One word about Haskell when you want to _use_ it and not to study it or play with it.

## Appendice - Tribulations

How I experienced web developement.

If you just want to know my choice without knowing why,
[click here to jump to the last section](#the-choice).

I'll try to discover what an ideal web framework might look like.

### Client side

First, creating a website necessitate a lot of different competences.
To begin, you need to know many different languages.
The bare minimum are:

  * %html
  * %css
  * javascript

For many historical reasons these languages have a _lot_ of weaknesses.
So a natural first step is to use better language for each case:

- for %html, use [HamL][haml] for example
- for %css, use [sass][sass] or [less][less]
- for javascript, use [coffeescript][cfs] or any other choice in this [huge list](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS).

Using these kind of language is a very good first step.
But after a while, we discover that this is not enough.

The problem is not only these languages are weak separately.
They also tend to not work properly together.
In fact, each language is far from independant to the other part.
This cause major difficulties in code organisation.

**Example**:
    Using the standard recommandation use as much HTML and CSS as possible.
    Don't use tables for layout and use as few javascript as possible.
    In particular, you must remember the solution must works
    at least on all modern browser (yes IE too).

> Try to create a webpage containing a single centered red box.
> The box containing a centered white text.
> 
> By centered I mean horizontally and _vertically_.
> Note the size of the box and of the text must be dynamic.
> I mean, the text can be on many lines and the box is Â¼ the size of the window for example.

Whatever the solution is (if there is one), it is certainly over complicated.
Generally, vertical center things dynamically with html and css is a nightmare.

Why isn't there something like:

``` html
<div id="redblock">
    <p>The text</p>
</div>
```

``` css
#redblock,
#redblock p {
    text-align: center;
    align: center middle; // <- Why doesn't this exist?
}
#redblock {
    width: 50%;
    height: 50%;
    background: #880000;
    color: #FFF;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

In search of minimizing the number of different languages you need to use.
The next natural step is to simply use javascript for everything.
Javascript can create %html and %css dynamically.
For example see [Cappuccino][cappuccino].
In fact, Cappuccino use [Objective-J][objj],
a language inspired from Objective-C which compile to javascript.

When I discovered [Cappuccino][cappuccino] I was really impressed.
You don't have to know %html nor %css to make highly responsive web application.
You just have to learn Objective-J.

Neat.

But this doesn't end here. For now I only talked about client side code.
If you want to create a real website you have to take care about the server side.
Here, as the layer is thinner (mostly HTTP) there are many different choices.

### Server side

Most programming languages have libraries or framework to help you create
a web server.

If you restrain yourself to the most popular for the most mainstream languages
you still need to choose between:
    Java J2EE,
    rails (ruby),
    django (python),
    Zend (PHP),
    node.js (javascript)

A more [complete list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#Others) gives you more than 100 choices for about 23 different programming languages.

So, nobody could compare all of them using all the most important metrics.
I mean, we could compare their response time given a specific project
[benchmarks](http://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/05/17/frameworks-round-5/).

But it is far more difficult to measure how easy it is to create a new web app.
To measure how easy it is to change something before launch and after your
application is launched.

For the startups the current trends appear to be node.js while rails and django
continue to be highly used.
Some continue to use PHP (Zend) even if it is critized more and more.

From my point of vue, the most important is to get started and finish something.
But clearly, it is harder to do a nice job with some language than with others.

So mostly you choose your preferred language and you program your website with it.

From here, you could start to think about an ideal system:

A single high level language that handle elegantly
both user interaction and server side logic.
The client side part being compiled to javascript and interacting with the
server side using only object representation (like with a JSON API).

So we might believe in a system where the server side code doesn't handle a bit
of %html. Which is the complete opposite of the current state of the art of
many web framework.

So ok, this is the ideal. Now the question. Could we achieve it today?

The closest framework today might be node.js.
But even with node, you need to know %html, %css and of course javascript.
Of course you could certainly use one of the client side framework (such as [Cappuccino][cappuccino]).

So for now, the web technologies seems to be splitted:
client-side vs. server-side.

As the future of the web seems to go toward more interaction with the user,
it feels natural to invest in front-end development instead of backend.
So rich front-end environment, make the very minimum on the server side.

But I personnally changed my mind by discovering a server side framework with
automatic bug detection.
It is not totally magic of course.
It doesn't prevent all bugs.
But most basic bugs you face in web programming are detected before you could deploy your app.

And so, such a marvellous server side framework posses too much power no to use
it at all on the client side.
So the question is.
How could we take advantage of the server side power on the client side?

After a bit, the answer start to become mostly evident.
Write a minimal (mostly verifiable) javascript library to handle
most user interaction.
So you end up writing widgets from the server.

Here is an example of what I mean:

``` html
<form action="/wrong/path" method="post">
    <input type="text" value="Enter your text"/>
</form>
```

There is a typical error here. Typically in a standard framework, such
action will written inside a template with a code looking mostly like:


``` html
<form action="/wrong/{{target}}" method="post">
    <input type="text" value="{{initial_text}}"/>
```

The problem is that I've written `/wrong/{{target}}` instead of `/foo/{{target}}`.
And so, I couldn't discover this small error if I don't try to use this action.
And if I didn't already written the '/foo/target' handler I couldn't detect
this error right now.
Or worse, if I make a bug fix but I am a bit lazy, and send it directly without 
making a basic test the error could be unoticied.

Bad, bad, bad.

Fortunately my web framework of choice, detect these kind of errors.
Because the code is as follow:

``` html
<form action="@{Foo target}" method="post">
    <input type="text" value="#{initial_text}"/>
```

and `@{Foo target}` will be replaced by `/foo/someValue`.
Yep.
