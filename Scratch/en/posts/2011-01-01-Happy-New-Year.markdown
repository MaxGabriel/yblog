Happy New Year!

I was busy during the last months. 
But I will revive a bit this blog.

I made a project to write book in markdown syntax and generating HTML and high quality PDF. I am not finished with this.

I had written an efficient _&_ simplistic MVC javascript framework.

Best wishes for _2011_!
