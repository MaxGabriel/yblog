%tldr Starting a Haskell Project tool with `cabal`, `git`, testing.


</div>

I recently read this excellent article:
[How to Start a New Haskell Project](http://jabberwocky.eu/2013/10/24/how-to-start-a-new-haskell-project/).

While the article is very good, I lacked some minor informations.
Also, I believe we could improve this a bit.
And this is also the kind of process you might repeat often.
This is why I created a simple shell script to initialize a new Haskell project.

So, mainly, if you do it manually the steps are:

1. [Install Haskell](http://wwW.haskell.org/platform)
2. Make sure you have the latest `cabal-install` (at least 1.18)

``` bash
> cabal install cabal-install
```

3. Download and run the script

``` bash
# Download the script
git clone https://github.com/yogsototh/init-haskell-project.git
# Copy the script in a directory of you PATH variable
cp init-haskell-project/holy-project.sh ~/bin
# Go to the directory containing all your projects
cd my/projects/e idi:
# Launch thcript
holy-haskell.sh
```

What does this script do that doesn't do cabal.

- Use cabal sandbox
- It initialize `git` with the right `.gitignore` file.
- Use `tasty` to organize your tests (HUnit, QuickCheck and SmallCheck).
- Use `-Wall` for GHC compilation.
- Will make references to Holy Grail
- Search your default github username via [github api](http://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-users).

## `zsh` really?

Developing the script in `zsh` was easy.
And while `zsh` is my favorite shell script, the size of this script
make it worth to write it in a more secure language.
Furthermore it will be a good exercise to translate
this script from `zsh` to Haskell.


### Patricide

So to make our development, let us initialize a new Haskell project with
`holy-haskell`.
Here is what its execution look like:

<pre>
> ./holy-haskell.sh
<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: Stop!
Bridgekeeper: Who would cross the Bridge of Death
Bridgekeeper: must answer me these questions three,
Bridgekeeper: ere the other side he see.</span>
<span class="yellow">You: Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper, I am not afraid.</span>

<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: What is the name of your project?</span>
> Holy project
<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: What is your name?</span> (Yann Esposito (Yogsototh))
>
<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: What is your email?</span> (Yann.Esposito@gmail.com)
>
<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: What is your github user name?</span> (yogsototh)
>
<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: What is your project in less than ten words?</span>
> Start your Haskell project with cabal, git and tests.

  coconut
    coconut:          <span class="green">OK</span>
    coconut property: <span class="green">OK</span>
      148 tests completed

<span class="green">All 3 tests passed</span>



<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?</span>
<span class="yellow">You: What do you mean? An African or European swallow?</span>
<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: Huh? I... I don't know that.</span>
[the bridgekeeper is thrown over]
<span class="green">Bridgekeeper: Auuuuuuuuuuuugh</span>
Sir Bedevere: How do you know so much about swallows?
<span class="yellow">You: Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know.</span>
</pre>

The different steps are:

- small introduction quotes
- ask five questions -- _three question sir..._
- create the directory for the project
- init git
- create files
- sandbox cabal
- cabal install and test
- run the test directly in the terminal
- small goodbye quotes

Things to note:

- color in the terminal
- check some rules on the project name
- random message if error
- use `~/.gitconfig` file in order to provide a default name and email.
- use the github API which returns JSON to get the default github user name.

So, apparently nothing too difficult to achieve.

### The dialogs

First lets us write a function which show the introduction text:

in `zsh`:

``` bash
# init colors
autoload colors
colors
for COLOR in RED GREEN YELLOW BLUE MAGENTA CYAN BLACK WHITE; do
    eval $COLOR='$fg_no_bold[${(L)COLOR}]'
    eval BOLD_$COLOR='$fg_bold[${(L)COLOR}]'
done
eval RESET='$reset_color'
# functions
bk(){print -- "${GREEN}Bridgekeeper: $*${RESET}"}
bkn(){print -n -- "${GREEN}Bridgekeeper: $*${RESET}"}
you(){print -- "${YELLOW}You: $*${RESET}"}
...
# the introduction dialog
bk "Stop!"
bk "Who would cross the Bridge of Death"
bk "must answer me these questions three,"
bk "ere the other side he see."
you "Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper, I am not afraid.\n"
...
# the final dialog
print "\n\n"
bk "What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?"
you "What do you mean? An African or European swallow?"
bk "Huh? I... I don't know that."
log "[the bridgekeeper is thrown over]"
bk "Auuuuuuuuuuuugh"
log "Sir Bedevere: How do you know so much about swallows?"
you "Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know."
```

In the first Haskell version I dont use colors.
We see we can almost copy/paste.
I just added the types.

``` haskell
bk :: String -> IO ()
bk str = putStrLn $ "Bridgekeeper: " ++ str

bkn :: String -> IO ()
bkn str = pustStr $ "Bridgekeeper: " ++ str

you :: String -> IO ()
you str = putStrLn $ "You: " ++ str

intro :: IO ()
intro = do
    bk "Stop!"
    bk "Who would cross the Bridge of Death"
    bk "must answer me these questions three,"
    bk "ere the other side he see."
    you "Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper, I am not afraid.\n"

end :: IO ()
end = do
    putStrLn "\n\n"
    bk "What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?"
    you "What do you mean? An African or European swallow?"
    bk "Huh? I... I don't know that."
    putStrLn "[the bridgekeeper is thrown over]"
    bk "Auuuuuuuuuuuugh"
    putStrLn "Sir Bedevere: How do you know so much about swallows?"
    you "Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know."
```

Now let's just add the colors using the
[`ansi-term`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ansi-terminal) package.
So we have to add `ansi-term` as a build dependency in our cabal file.

Edit `holy-project.cabal` to add it.

```
...
build-depends:  base >=4.6 && <4.7
                , ansi-terminal
...
```

Now look at the modified Haskell code:

``` haskell
import System.Console.ANSI

output :: ConsoleIntensity -> ColorIntensity -> Color -> String -> IO ()
output bold intensity color str = do
    setSGR  [ SetColor Foreground intensity color
            , SetConsoleIntensity bold
            ]
    putStr str
    setSGR []


bk :: String -> IO ()
bk str = output NormalIntensity Dull Green ("Bridgekeeper: " ++ str ++ "\n")
bkn :: String -> IO ()
bkn str = output NormalIntensity Dull Green ("Bridgekeeper: " ++ str)
you :: String -> IO ()
you str = output NormalIntensity Dull Yellow ("Bridgekeeper: " ++ str ++ "\n")

intro :: IO ()
intro = do
    bk "Stop!"
    bk "Who would cross the Bridge of Death"
    bk "must answer me these questions three,"
    bk "ere the other side he see."
    you "Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper, I am not afraid.\n"

end :: IO ()
end = do
    putStrLn "\n\n"
    bk "What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?"
    you "What do you mean? An African or European swallow?"
    bk "Huh? I... I don't know that."
    putStrLn "[the bridgekeeper is thrown over]"
    bk "Auuuuuuuuuuuugh"
    putStrLn "Sir Bedevere: How do you know so much about swallows?"
    you "Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know."
```

For now we could put this code inside `src/Main.hs`.
Declare a main function:

``` haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
    intro
    end
```

Make `cabal install` and run `./.cabal-sandbox/bin/holy-project`.
It works!



## Questions

In order to ask questions, here is how we do it in shell script:

``` bash
print -- "What is your name?"
read name
```

If we want to abstract things a bit, the easiest way in shell is to use
a global variable[^1] which will get the value of the user input like this:

``` bash
answer=""
ask(){
    local info="$1"
    bk "What is your $info?"
    print -n "> "
    read answer
}
...
ask name
name="$answer"
```

[^1]: There is now easy way to do something like `name=$(ask name)`.
      Simply because `$(ask name)` run in another process which
      doesn't get access to the standard input

In Haskell we won't need any global variable:

``` haskell
import System.IO (hFlush, stdout)
...
ask :: String -> IO String
ask info = do
    bk $ "What is your " ++ info ++ "?"
    putStr "> "
    hFlush stdout -- Because we want to ask on the same line.
    getLine
```

Now our main function might look like:

``` haskell
main = do
    intro
    _ <- ask "project name"
    _ <- ask "name"
    _ <- ask "email"
    _ <- ask "github account"
    _ <- ask "project in less than a dozen word"
    end
```

You could test it with `cabal install` and
then `./.cabal-sandbox/bin/holy-project`.

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# --- Function declaration and global variables
answer=""
# Capitalize a string
capitalize(){
    local str="$(print -- "$*" | sed 's/-/ /g')"
    print -- ${(C)str} | sed 's/ //g'
}
err(){
    {
    case $(( $RANDOM % 1 )); in
    0)  bk "What... is your favourite colour?"
        you "Blue. No, yel..."
        log "[You are thrown over the edge into the volcano]"
        you "You: Auuuuuuuuuuuugh"
        bk " Hee hee heh."
        ;;
    1)  bk "What is the capital of Assyria?"
        you "I don't know that!"
        log "[You are thrown over the edge into the volcano]"
        you "Auuuuuuuuuuuugh"
        ;;
    esac

    print -- "\n$*"
    }>&2
    exit 1
}
# Ask the user for some information
# Search in .gitconfig some hints to provide default value
ask(){
    local elem=$1
    local gitconfigelem
    bkn "What is your $elem?"
    [[ -e ~/.gitconfig ]] && {
        gitconfigelem="$(< ~/.gitconfig| awk '$1 == "'$elem'" {$1="";$2="";gsub("^ *","");print}')"
        [[ $gitconfigelem = "" ]] || {
            print -n -- " ($gitconfigelem)"
        }
    }
    print -n "\n> ";read answer
    [[ $answer = "" ]] && answer=$gitconfigelem
}

reinit(){
    cd ..
    [[ -e $project ]] && \rm -rf $project
    err "Something went wrong, I removed the project directory"
}
