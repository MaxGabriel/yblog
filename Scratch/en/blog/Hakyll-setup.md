The website your are reading is done with [Hakyll][hakyll]

[Hakyll][hakyll] can be considered as a minimal %cms.
But more generally it is a way to organize file generation.

My current workflow is:

1. open a Terminal, launch my script `preview.sh`.
2. open my browser on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
3. Write (customized) markdown files
4. Time to time, I reload the browser to the corresponding file.
5. Return to 3 up until I am satisfied with the result.

Mainly, when I modify a markdown file, it generates an %html file.

It sounds easy, but there are a lot of decisions and parameters to think about.
I will show you which they are.
