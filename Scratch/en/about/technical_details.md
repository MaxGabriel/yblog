This website was completely made from scratch.  Most is done using
[Vim](http://www.vim.org) and I generate pages using
[nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org).

Pictures were done with
<a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> and
<a href="http://gimp.org">Gimp</a>.
My website is versionned using the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Concurrent_Versions_System">
    <acronym title="Distributed Concurrent Versions System">DCVS</acronym>
</a>
<a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>.

Blog comments are externalized to <del>[disqus](http://disqus.com)</del> [intense debate](http://intensedebate.com).
All I need is a static web server, no PHP, Java, ASP or CGI.
Main advantages of this method concerns the load
and the security of the server.

If you didn't understood anything, just remember I used only
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSource">Opensource</a>
and I mostly all done myself from scratch.
