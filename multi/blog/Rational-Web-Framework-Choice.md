This is it.  
You've got your idea.  
You know you will be rich.  
You just need to make a very simple web application.

It sounds easy!
Glory is just around the corner.
You just need to choose a good modern web framework, when suddenly:

blogfigure("choice_paralysis.gif","[Choice Paralysis][choice_paralysis]")

[choice_paralysis]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis

After your brain stack overflowed, you decide to use a very simple methodology.
Answer two questions:

**Which language am I familiar with?  
What is the most popular web framework for this language?**

Great! This is it.

But, the night when you are alone in your bed, your hear this little voice.
You know the one.

> **"You didn't made a bad choice, yes. But ...  
> you hadn't made the best either."**

The question I try to answer here is how to determine the most objectively
and rationaly possible the best(s) web framework(s).

I will use the following methodology:

> ### Methodology
> 
> 1. Model how to make choice 
>     a. choose important parameters
>     b. organize (hierarchize) them
>     c. write down an objective chooser
> 2. Grab objective quantified informations about web frameworks relatively to choosen parameters
> 3. Sanitize your data in order to handle imprecisions, lack of informations...
> 4. Apply the model of choice to your informations

## Model

Here are the important features (parameters) I decided to use for my choice:

1. _**Expressiveness**_, which is generally correlated to:
    - faster development
    - flexibility, adaptability

2. _**Robustness**_, which correlate with:
    - security
    - fewer bugs

3. _**Efficiency**_, which is generally correlated to:
    - how much processing power you'll need per user
    - maintenance price per user
    - how long the user will wait to see/update data

4. _**Popularity**_, which correlate with:
    - number of tested libraries
    - facility to find learning material
    - ability to find another developer to work with

Each feature is quite important and mostly independant from each other.

Unfortunately, these kind of properties are very hard to measure with precision.
In fact we could only get order of magnitude for each.
In the end, we will have _clusters_.

------------------ ----------- ------- -------- -------- ---------
**Efficiency**       Excellent    Good  Correct     Slow  Sluggish
**Robustness**       Excellent    Good  Correct      Bad    Unsafe
**Expressiveness**        High  Medium      Low
**Popularity**      Mainstream  Medium      Low  Obscure
------------------ ----------- ------- -------- -------- ---------

So how to make a decision model from these informations?

One of the most versatile method is to give a weight for each cluster value.
And to select the framework maximizing this score:

```
score(framework) = efficiency × robustness × expressiveness × popularity
```

For example:

-------------- ---- --- --- --- ---
Efficiency      100  80  50  30  10
Robustness      100  80  50  30  10
Expressiveness  100  50  10
Popularity      10   10   0   0
-------------- ---- --- --- --- ---

Using this weighted table, that means we discard the two last popular clusters.
And we don't make any difference between popular and mildly popular frameworks.

Also, excellent expressive framework are 10x more likely to be chosen than worst expressive class.

So for each framework we compute its score relatively to a weighted table.
And we select the best(s).

The weighted table parameter depending on your needs.
You might not need a fast framework, nor a popular one for example.
In the choice section, we will discuss this further.

It is now time to try to get these measures.

## Objective measures

None of these property can be measured with perfect precision.
But each time we should get an order of magnitude for each.
Some properties feels easier to measure than other.

For example, popularity measure can be quite correct (at least for the most popular languages).
It is more complex to measure the efficiency, expressiveness and easiness, but
we can have good enough indicators.

As each indicator lack of precision, we will focus on giving order of magnitude.

### Popularity

[RedMonk Programming Language Rankings (January 2013)][redmonk]
provide an apparent good measure of popularity.
While not perfect the current measure feel mostly right.
They create an image using stack overflow and github data.
Vertical correspond to the number of questions on stackoverflow.
Horizontal correspond to the number of projects on github.

If you look at the image, your eye can see about four clusters.
The 1ﬆ cluster correspond to mainstream languages:

blogfigure("mainstreamlanguages.png","Mainstream Languages Cluster from [RedMonk][redmonk]")

Most developer know at least one of these language.

The second cluster is quite bigger.
It seems to correspond to languages with a solid community behind them.

blogfigure("secondtierlanguages.png","Second tier languages from [RedMonk][redmonk]")

[redmonk]: http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2013/02/28/language-rankings-1-13/

I don't get into detail, but you could also see third and fourth tier popular languages.

So:

**Mainstream**:
JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, `C#`, `C++`, `C`, Objective-C, Perl, Shell

**Good**: Scala, Haskell, Visual Basic, Assembly, R, Matlab, ASP, ActionScript, Coffeescript,
Groovy, Clojure, Lua, Prolog

**Medium**: Erlang, Go, Delphi, D, Racket, Scheme, ColdFusion,
F#, FORTRAN, Arduino, Tcl, Ocaml

**Bad**: third tier
**Very Bad**: fourth tier

I don't thing I could find easily web frameworks for third or fourth tier languages.

### Efficiency

Another objective measure is efficiency.
We all know benchmarks are all flawed.
But they give an idea of magniture order:

I used the benchmark from [benchmarksgame](http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all&data=u64q). Mainly, there are five clusters:

----------- ----------------------------------------------------------
1x→2x       `C`, `C++`, ADA, Fortran, [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org/)
2x→3x       Java 7, Scala, OCamL, Haskell, Go, Common LISP
3x→10x      C♯, Clojure,, Pascal, Racket, Dart
10x→30x     Erlang
30x→        PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby, JRuby
----------- ----------------------------------------------------------

Remarks concerning some very slow languages:

* PHP ; huge variations, can be about 1.5x C speed in best case.
* Python ; huge variations, can be about 1.5x C speed in best case
* Perl ; Can be about 3x C speed in best case
* Ruby, JRuby ; mostly very slow.

This is a first approach.
The speed of the language for basic benchmarks.
But, here we are interrested in web programming.
Fortunately techempower has made some tests focused on most web frameworks:

[Web framework benchmarks](http://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/07/02/frameworks-round-6/).

These benchmark doesn't fit well with our needs.
The values are certainly quite imprecise to your real usage.
The goal is just to get a magnitude order idea for each framework.
Another problem is the high number of informations.

As always, these value quite informative are also quite imprecise relatively to 
how all of this will respond for your own application.
So I simply made some classes of efficiency.
This measure can be quite important, because it will mean your
application will need more money to run.
Typically, 2x, means you'll need twice the computer power to achieve the same result.
If the framework works as expected, that will mean paying for two computer instead of only one.

Table: More than 50x

These are manually made clusters. But you get the idea.
Certainly, some framework could jump between two different clusters.
So this is something to remember.

# Expressiveness

Now, how to objectively measure expressiveness?

Here is a very good idea that helped to give an objective (while imprecise)
metrics of each language expressiveness:
[click here](http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/).

After filtering languages suitable for web development,
we end up with some clusters:


---------  -----------
Cluster    Languages
---------  -----------
Excellent   Coffeescript,
            Clojure,
            Haskell

Very Good   Racket,
            Groovy, R, Scala,
            OCamL, F♯, Erlang, Lisp, Go

Medium      Perl, Python, Objective-C,
            Scheme, Tcl, Ruby

Bad         Lua, Fortran (free-format)
            PHP, Java, C++, C♯

Worst       Assembly, C,
            Javascript,
---------  -----------

### Robustness

I couldn't find any complete study to give the number of bug relatively
to each framework/language.

But on thing I saw from experience is the more powerful the type system the
safest your application is.
While the type system doesn't remove completely the need to test your application
a very good type system tend to remove complete classes of bug.

Typically, not using pointer in help to reduce the number of bugs due to bad references.
Also, using a garbage collector, reduce greatly the probability to access unallocated space.

blogfigure("languagesafety.png","Static Type Properties from [James IRY Blog][typesanalysis]")

[typesanalysis]: http://james-iry.blogspot.fr/2010/05/types-la-chart.html

Also we end up with clusters:

## The choice

Here is a very simple application helping you to decide.
I made some pre choice for you:

## Personal choice

* **Front end**: Take any reactive framework. The most popular is boostrap, so why not?
Most informations are in the %html. So could be handled on the server side.
* **Server side**: Yesod

One word about Haskell when you want to _use_ it and not to study it or play with it.

## Appendice - Tribulations

How I experienced web developement.

If you just want to know my choice without knowing why,
[click here to jump to the last section](#the-choice).

I'll try to discover what an ideal web framework might look like.

### Client side

First, creating a website necessitate a lot of different competences.
To begin, you need to know many different languages.
The bare minimum are:

  * %html
  * %css
  * javascript

For many historical reasons these languages have a _lot_ of weaknesses.
So a natural first step is to use better language for each case:

- for %html, use [HamL][haml] for example
- for %css, use [sass][sass] or [less][less]
- for javascript, use [coffeescript][cfs] or any other choice in this [huge list](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/wiki/List-of-languages-that-compile-to-JS).

Using these kind of language is a very good first step.
But after a while, we discover that this is not enough.

The problem is not only these languages are weak separately.
They also tend to not work properly together.
In fact, each language is far from independant to the other part.
This cause major difficulties in code organisation.

**Example**:
    Using the standard recommandation use as much HTML and CSS as possible.
    Don't use tables for layout and use as few javascript as possible.
    In particular, you must remember the solution must works
    at least on all modern browser (yes IE too).

> Try to create a webpage containing a single centered red box.
> The box containing a centered white text.
> 
> By centered I mean horizontally and _vertically_.
> Note the size of the box and of the text must be dynamic.
> I mean, the text can be on many lines and the box is ¼ the size of the window for example.

Whatever the solution is (if there is one), it is certainly over complicated.
Generally, vertical center things dynamically with html and css is a nightmare.

Why isn't there something like:

``` html
<div id="redblock">
    <p>The text</p>
</div>
```

``` css
#redblock,
#redblock p {
    text-align: center;
    align: center middle; // <- Why doesn't this exist?
}
#redblock {
    width: 50%;
    height: 50%;
    background: #880000;
    color: #FFF;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

In search of minimizing the number of different languages you need to use.
The next natural step is to simply use javascript for everything.
Javascript can create %html and %css dynamically.
For example see [Cappuccino][cappuccino].
In fact, Cappuccino use [Objective-J][objj],
a language inspired from Objective-C which compile to javascript.

When I discovered [Cappuccino][cappuccino] I was really impressed.
You don't have to know %html nor %css to make highly responsive web application.
You just have to learn Objective-J.

Neat.

But this doesn't end here. For now I only talked about client side code.
If you want to create a real website you have to take care about the server side.
Here, as the layer is thinner (mostly HTTP) there are many different choices.

### Server side

Most programming languages have libraries or framework to help you create
a web server.

If you restrain yourself to the most popular for the most mainstream languages
you still need to choose between:
    Java J2EE,
    rails (ruby),
    django (python),
    Zend (PHP),
    node.js (javascript)

A more [complete list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_application_frameworks#Others) gives you more than 100 choices for about 23 different programming languages.

So, nobody could compare all of them using all the most important metrics.
I mean, we could compare their response time given a specific project
[benchmarks](http://www.techempower.com/blog/2013/05/17/frameworks-round-5/).

But it is far more difficult to measure how easy it is to create a new web app.
To measure how easy it is to change something before launch and after your
application is launched.

For the startups the current trends appear to be node.js while rails and django
continue to be highly used.
Some continue to use PHP (Zend) even if it is critized more and more.

From my point of vue, the most important is to get started and finish something.
But clearly, it is harder to do a nice job with some language than with others.

So mostly you choose your preferred language and you program your website with it.

From here, you could start to think about an ideal system:

A single high level language that handle elegantly
both user interaction and server side logic.
The client side part being compiled to javascript and interacting with the
server side using only object representation (like with a JSON API).

So we might believe in a system where the server side code doesn't handle a bit
of %html. Which is the complete opposite of the current state of the art of
many web framework.

So ok, this is the ideal. Now the question. Could we achieve it today?

The closest framework today might be node.js.
But even with node, you need to know %html, %css and of course javascript.
Of course you could certainly use one of the client side framework (such as [Cappuccino][cappuccino]).

So for now, the web technologies seems to be splitted:
client-side vs. server-side.

As the future of the web seems to go toward more interaction with the user,
it feels natural to invest in front-end development instead of backend.
So rich front-end environment, make the very minimum on the server side.

But I personnally changed my mind by discovering a server side framework with
automatic bug detection.
It is not totally magic of course.
It doesn't prevent all bugs.
But most basic bugs you face in web programming are detected before you could deploy your app.

And so, such a marvellous server side framework posses too much power no to use
it at all on the client side.
So the question is.
How could we take advantage of the server side power on the client side?

After a bit, the answer start to become mostly evident.
Write a minimal (mostly verifiable) javascript library to handle
most user interaction.
So you end up writing widgets from the server.

Here is an example of what I mean:

``` html
<form action="/wrong/path" method="post">
    <input type="text" value="Enter your text"/>
</form>
```

There is a typical error here. Typically in a standard framework, such
action will written inside a template with a code looking mostly like:


``` html
<form action="/wrong/{{target}}" method="post">
    <input type="text" value="{{initial_text}}"/>
```

The problem is that I've written `/wrong/{{target}}` instead of `/foo/{{target}}`.
And so, I couldn't discover this small error if I don't try to use this action.
And if I didn't already written the '/foo/target' handler I couldn't detect
this error right now.
Or worse, if I make a bug fix but I am a bit lazy, and send it directly without 
making a basic test the error could be unoticied.

Bad, bad, bad.

Fortunately my web framework of choice, detect these kind of errors.
Because the code is as follow:

``` html
<form action="@{Foo target}" method="post">
    <input type="text" value="#{initial_text}"/>
```

and `@{Foo target}` will be replaced by `/foo/someValue`.
Yep.
